## Mainpulating the Front End with Rails

#### Road Map
1. Adding Fonts
2. Adding View-Specific Style Pages the Rails Way
3. Adding View-Specific Scripts

## My 7 Year Old Kid Cousin Rapper

I mistakenly left my '36 Chambers' album in my kid cousin's room 3 years 
ago and ever since he's told my Aunt he wants to be a rapper.

I'm never getting invited back.

## Help Cool Brandon with his Site

Brandon wants to make a website for his rap career, but can't get view 
specific styling onto his page. This is your chance to help me patch 
things up with my Aunt.

### Adding Fonts: Url's with Rails

1. Add a `fonts/` directory to the `assets/` directory.

2. Add your custom `.tff` to `fonts/`

3. In your `static_pages.scss` file, add:

```scss
@font-face {
  font-family: 'abite';
  src: font-url('ABITE.ttf');
  src: font-url('ABITE.ttf') format('truetype');
}

h1 {
  font-family: 'abite', Fallback, sans-serif;
  font-spacing: .3rem;
  font-size: 5rem;
}
```

__PS: My .tff is called ABITE__

### Adding View-Specific Stylesheets the Rails Way

1. Remove `*= require_tree .` from `application.css` and replace 
   with `*= require static_pages`

2. Add css page `about.scss` to the `assets/stylesheets/` directory

3. Add style tag: `<%= stylesheet_link_tag 'about' %>` at the top of
   the `about.html.erb` file.

4. Then add to the `assets.rb` in `/config/initializers/`:

	`Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( about.css )`

### Adding View-Specific Scripts the Rails Way

There's a similar order to things with scripts. 

1. Add `contact.js` in your `assets/javascripts` directory

2. Add the script tag to the page: 
	`<%= javascript_include_tag 'contact' %>`

3. Add to `contact.js`:

	```javascript
	console.log('linked!');
	
	(document.getElementById('take').onkeyup = function(){
	    $('#place').text($('#take').val());
	})();
	```
4. Then add to the `assets.rb` in `/config/initializers/`:

	`Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( contact.js )`

5. Finally, don't forget to bring up `app/assets/javascripts/application.js` and
replace:

	`//= require_tree .`

	with

	`//= require static_pages`

#### Working with the Asset Pipeline: Precompile

Precompile your assets - this is calling what's set in 
`config/initializers/assets.rb`:

	`rake assets:precompile`

Before production, clear the precompile (since Heroku runs it when
deployed):

	`rake assets:clobber`

See all the options:

	`rake -T`
