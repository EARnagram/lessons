/* ACT 2 */

/* No one knew why Batman hated Arnold so much. But Batman had plans to erase
Arnold from the planet forever. He was building an army. */

	// Build a henchbat (henchmen, but for batman) constructor function
	// Have a health key

	// Have a scream key

plan up his sleeve. */

/* Arnold came to Gotham, the supposed streets of Batman. He was determined to
defeat the evil Batman. He went to the nearest gun shop and bought a shotgun.*/

	// Push the string "Hasta la Vista... baby." into arnold.oneLiners

	// It should take three enemies and reduces their health by 100.

/* On one of Batman's nightly patrols, he sees Arnold roaming his streets with 
a shotgun! Batman sends out three henchmen to take out Arnold. */

	// Have a gunfight in the streets of gotham!
	// Make sure Arnold wins!

/* Arnold was bloodied and bruised, but he was ready for more. Batman looked down
on him from a steeple. He called out

"Hey Arnold! You won't make it out of these streets alive."

"But I've done nothing to you! Why all de death, Batman?" replied Arnold.

"It's not what you've done - it's what you did do in the future." 

Arnold was confused. How could he have done something in the future?

He realized, if he was going to make it out of this alive, he needed bigger 
weapons. */

/* ACT 3 */

/* Arnold bought a ton of dynamite for his next encounter with the Batman. */

 of Arnold to defeat his nemesis. */

	// Give them 5 descriptive keys
	// Make sure one is a health key and another is a scream key

	// Create 7 terminators

/* Arnold received a mysterious letter in the mail from a CW that showed a map
to the Batcave.  With dynamite in hand, Arnold felt ready to take on the Batman. 

However, just to be safe, he decided to have a cell phone where he could call his
friends. */

	// Add cellphone key to arnold and set it to true.

	// Create a constructor function for Arnold's friends.
	// Make 5 distinct keys
	// Ensure they have a function that affects an enemy
	// Make sure they have a scream and a health key.
	// Make sure each reference the arnold object as a bestFriend property

	// Create 3 friends
	// Make sure one of them is Carl Weathers

/* Arnold goes to the batcave with his cellphone and dynamite. And an enormous
battle ensues. */


	// Create a fight between Arnold and terminators
	// When Arnold's health gets low, bring in his friends!

	// Defeat the terminators (bring their health down to 0.

/* Arnold has batman cornered. He's hurt, and isn't going anywhere.

"Why did you kill my parents? Why are you so set on fighting me?" bellowed Arnold.

"You ruined me Conan Arnold - you destroyed the idea of Batman. You will turn us 
into a joke when you play Mr. Freeze!"

Arnold was hurt - he had no idea his future would hurt Batman so bad.

In fact, he was so hurt, he decided to ice Batman.
*/


	// push "What killed de Dinosaurs? DE ICE AGE!" to arnold.oneLiners
	// Add an ice method to arnold that brings an enemy down to zero and 
	// logs out a arnold.oneLiners[4]

/* Then Carl Weathers high fived Arnold and the world was saved from Batman.
