## Intro to the Box Model

![Panels](http://www.collectivenext.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/blog-images/understanding-comics-p61.png?itok=iibrRHw2)

I'm going to first make a crazy comparison, and follow it up with a wild
assumption.

First, for the comparison:

>  *Website design is quite similar to comics' panel layout.*
>
> — Ezra Arez Raez, 2016

Now for the wild assumption: open chrome and visit any site.

Now, if you'll relax your eyes as you stare into that website, I'm sure you'll
make out a number of rectangles in that site - go ahead, count them! In fact,
turn on your chrome inspector to prove it!

I can assume this because, much like comics - predominantly relying on the
rectangular panel for the majority of their page layout - **the web is made of
rectangles.**

We use HTML to decide what rectangles we want and what should go in them.

We use CSS to decide how they should look (recall this morning's lesson), and
where they should go.

##### Assets

Today we'll be working from the `starter_code/` directory.

## The Box Model and its Components

You may be familiar with the following diagram:

![box-model](http://s6.postimg.org/gi8r6c341/css_box_model.png)

Open Chrome's Dev Tools by using cmd+opt+i.

Click "Elements" (in the dev tools toolbar), then `<div id="box-model">` in the
page source. Find the multicolored rectangles at the bottom of "Styles."

- **Margin** - The empty area around a border, where we don't want anything else
  on the page to render.
- **Border** - A solid (or dashed, or dotted, etc.) line around the padding and
  content. Can be zero pixels (invisible) or bigger.
- **Padding** - The area between the border and the content, where we can give
  the content some breathing room
- **Content** - The contents of the box; also what we size when we set a width
  and height in CSS.
- **Box-Sizing** - `box-sizing` is an interesting property. By default it's set
  to `content-box`, but we often assume sizing works in terms `border-box`. The
  difference is subtle but important. `content-box` sets the `height` and
  `width` properties of a box to the content, whereas `border-box` assigns them
  to border, therefore including the border's size and padding.

Let's add to our `.box-model` class and see what these do:

``` css
.box-model {
  margin: 50px auto;
  border: 3px solid red;
  padding: 50px;
  width: 100px;
}
```

#### Love thy Dev Tools

Chrome's Dev Tools are one of the nicest things to ever happen to developers.
This is because we can alter our webpages __while__ viewing them in the browser!

Take the next few minutes to play with the following:

- **Margins** - Remember that the values for a single margin property works
  clockwise from the top, `margin: Abovepx Rightpx Belowpx Leftpx;`
- **Borders** - Find new textures and sizes.
- **Padding** - See what negative values can accomplish.
- **Height, Width, and Box-Sizing** - See what these do to your box!

> Remember, if you've ever gone too far off the deep-end, simply refresh the
page!

## Display

![inline vs block](http://netdna.webdesignerdepot.com/uploads/2012/08/boxmodel-block-vs-inline.png)

At the heart of positioning is the `display` property. There are five values
that greatly effect our webpage.

1. An **inline** element renders without a line break above or below it, so that
   other content is right next to it. __Inline elements can't be given a width,
   height, or margins.__
2. A **block** element renders with a line break above and below it, so they
   don't have anything next to them. By default, they take up the entire width
   of their parent element. Block elements can be given a height and a width.
3. An **inline-block** element is placed as an inline element (on the same line
   as adjacent content), but it behaves like a block element. This makes the
   element a block box but will allow other elements to sit next to it on the
   same line.
4. If you assign **none** as the value of the display, this will make the
   element and its content disappear from the page entirely!
5. **flex** is a new and interesting display option for CSS3. We'll cover it in 
   greater detail in a later lesson on responsive CSS, so I don't want to spend 
   too much time on it now. However just to mention, it reduces the need for 
   floats (see below in "Positioning") and removes the margins between things. 
   It essentially makes your positioning more *flexible*, while simultaneously 
   making your site less accommodating (`display: flex;` will not work with 
   browsers IE9 and older).

Lets see the difference between inline, block, and inline-block by adding these
rules to our stylesheet.

``` css
.inline-vs-block {
  border: 3px dotted gray;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}

.inline-block {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

#### Practice Display

In `<div id="inline-vs-block">`, notice what happens when you change width,
height, margin, and padding for inline, block, and inline-block elements.

Take a few minutes to alter these in the Chrome Dev Tools.

## Positioning

![](http://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmvr2tIqya1qi9hg0o1_500.gif)

The `position` property in CSS allows the content to move around the page in
four separate fashions: static, relative, absolute, and fixed.

##### Static Positioning

HTML elements are `position: static` by default. A "static positioned" element
is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page and are not
affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

##### Relative Positioning

Declaring `position:relative` allows you to position the element top, bottom,
left, or right relative to where it would normally occur.

##### Absolute Positioning

Setting `position: absolute` on an element lets you position it according to
the edges of its parent element. This has the side effect of removing it from
the flow– that is, other elements will act like it isn't there.

##### Fixed Positioning

An element with `position: fixed` is positioned relative to the edges of the
browser window.  It will not move even if the window is scrolled, so a fixed
positioned element will stay right where it is.

### CSS Directions

Siblings to the `position` property, the `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom`
properties are known as the CSS Directions. By Default, they're set to `auto`,
and these properties do nothing while `position: static;`. They move an element
by adding a pixel amount to the respective direction between it and the nearest
element or border.

Again, let's see what happens when we add these new position properties to our
code (go ahead and overwrite classes `.spacing container`, `.one`, `.two`,
`.three`, and `.four`).

``` css
.spacing-container {
  height: 500px;
  width: 500px;
  background-color: gray;
  position: relative;
}

.one {
  background-color: red;
  position: static;
}

.two {
  background-color: blue;
  position: relative;
  top: -100px;
  left: 100px;
}

.three {
  background-color: green;
  position: absolute;
  top: 200px;
  left: 200px;
}

.four {
  background-color: black;
  position: fixed;
  right: 100px;
  top: 80%;
}
```

## Floats

The float property defines whether or not an element should stick to the side
and contain it's own line.

![Float Layout](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/40461/8234489/3b61ef02-15d4-11e5-8864-435fb6e0c3cc.png)

Note that "absolutely positioned" elements ignore the float property as they are
removed from the normal document flow - same with "fixed" elements.

Floated elements remain a part of the flow of the web page.

There are four valid values for the float property. "Left" and "right" float
elements those directions, respectively. "None" (the default) ensures the
element will not float and "inherit" which will assume the float value from that
element's parent element.

### Clear

As a sister attribute to Float, `clear` allows an element to ignore float rules,
and move itself *past* the float. You can set a clear to `left`, `right`,
`both`, and `none` (default).

Compare these two photos. A footer with `clear:none;`.

Versus a footer with `clear: both` or `clear: left`:

![](https://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/clearedfooter.png)

Finally, let's see how these floats work!

``` css
.img-example {
  float: left;
  width: 400px;
}

.columns > div {
  float: left;
  width: 50%;
}
```

## Outro

Like drawing comics, CSS positioning takes time to master. It can be a struggle
early on, but consistent practice will eventually lead to full grokking.

As you can see, viewing html elements as the rectangular panels that they are
will assist you in conquering this tricky CSS beast.
