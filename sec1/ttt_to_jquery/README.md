## Tic-Tac-Toe with jQuery

In this directory, you'll find a solution for tic tac toe.

Using what you learned today, please attempt to 
**translate the vanilla JS into jQuery**!

If everything goes well, you should see the length of your code drop 
dramatically.

Don't forget to include a jQuery CDN: 

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.0.min.js"></script>
```

Good Luck!
