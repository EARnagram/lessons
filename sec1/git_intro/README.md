## Intro to Git and GitHub

| Learning Objectives: SWBAT               |
| :--------------------------------------- |
| Use `git init` to create a repo |
| Use `git clone` to clone a repo |
| Describe what happens when you initialize a new Git repository |
| Use `man git` and `git --help` to remind you of usage and Git's "subcommands." |
| Use `git add /dir` and `git add -A` |
| Write git commits using `git commit -m "write commit message"` |
| Find and explain the purpose of the `.gitignore`, `.gitignore_global`, and `.gitconfig` files |

#### Roadmap

1. Git Plans for the Worst
2. What is a Git Repository?
3. Checkpoints - Saving your Work
4. Report to Base - Storing your Repo on GitHub
5. Revert to Previous Fork in Mt. Repo - Returning to a Previous Commit
6. Outro

## Git Plans for the Worst


As a developer, confined to the indoors, you begin to hunger for the great
outdoors. You demand the extreme, and set your sights on the mighty Mt. Repo of
Nepal - an uninhabited, uncharted, and magnificent defiance of man.

You will inhabit that land! You will climb and build! Nothing can stop you!!

When you reach Nepal, your friendly Sherpa "Git" has welcomed you to the brutal
mountain. Git promises to keep you safe in the wild as he intends to use an
ancient safety system: Version Control.

You feel safe in his presence - it's like nothing could ever go wrong…

#### Git, the code Sherpa

In programming, we write a ton of code. No big surprise there.

Not only do we write a lot of code, but we tend to write a lot of bad code. Not
only bad, but weeks long soirées in the wrong direction.   

Luckily, most programmers use a kind of time-machine (or Sherpa… however you
want to think about it) called a Version Control System. It saves __states__ of
your code - allowing you to return to moments before taking a deeply flawed
direction.

You save a state by _committing_ your code to a _repository_, a directory
containing a `/.git` - essentially the project you want backed up.

Think of commits as flag markers at forking paths when ascending a steep
mountain, the project. Stay tethered to these commits and you can always get
back to previous moments in scaling the mountain!!
