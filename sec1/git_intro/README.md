## Intro to Git and GitHub

| Learning Objectives: SWBAT               |
| :--------------------------------------- |
| Use `git init` to create a repo |
| Describe what happens when you initialize a new Git repository |
| Use `man git` and `git --help` to remind you of usage and Git's "subcommands." |
| Use `git add /dir` and `git add -A` |
| Write git commits using `git commit -m "write commit message"` |
| Use `hub-create` and `hub-browse ` to add or open GitHub pages for a Git repo |
| Describe the `origin` repository |
| Use `git push origin master` to update your hosted git repository |
| Find and explain the purpose of the `.gitignore`, `.gitignore_global`, and `.gitconfig` files |
| Use a commit's SHA-1 with `git reset --hard` to return to a previous commit |
| Use `git stash` and `git stash pop` save work when resetting |

#### Roadmap

1. Plan for the Worst - Terraforming Mt. Repo on Planet X
2. What is a Git Repository?
3. Checkpoints - Saving your Work
4. Report to Base - Storing your Repo on GitHub
5. Revert to Previous Fork in Mt. Repo - Returning to a Previous Commit
6. Outro

## Plan for the Worst - Terraforming Mt. Repo on Planet X

It's the future.

The year is 1965 and JFK is serving his 2nd term.
After we win the space race, NASA pushes to start terraforming Planet X, out past Pluto (not a planet).
