## The Last Lock is Always the Biggest

Prototypal Inheritance in JavaScript is the keystone to understanding 
the true power available to us as JS programmers. In fact, understanding 
prototypal inheritance will likely give you the ability to read nearly 
any JS library and have an idea of what's going on.

JavaScript's prototypal inheritance often gets a bad name, but with 
greater appreciation of the model we can see that it's actually:

1. Extremely powerful!
2. It's "simple" (but not necessarily easier to comprehend).
3. It Leads to DRY code as there is less need to repeat yourself.
4. It's dynamic and therefore better for a dynamic language like JS.

Let's quickly dive into the differences of Classical and Prototypal 
Inheritance to see how the models contrast.

## Classical vs Prototypal Inheritance

Often, you'll see `neckbeards` of the JS persuasion claim that 
prototypal inheritance is "better" than classical inheritance.

While this is clearly subjective, their reasons are often some collection of the following:

| Classical Inheritance                                                                    | Prototypal Inheritance                                                                   |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Classes are immutable. You can't modify or add new methods to them at runtime.           | Prototypes are flexible. They may be either mutable or immutable.                        |
| Classes may or may not support multiple inheritance.                                     | Objects can inherit from multiple prototypes.                                            |
| It's verbose and complicated. You have abstract classes, final classes, interfaces, etc. | It's simple. You only have objects and extending objects is the only operation required. |

This table is pointing to the power of JS' prototypal inheritance model. 
Unlike in a class system, prototypes offer us endless options (remember, 
it's dynamic and DRY!). It also has the simplicity factor going for it. 

Where classical inheritance has:

1. Classes.
2. Object.
3. Interfaces.
4. Abstract Classes.
5. Final Classes.
6. Virtual Base Classes.
7. Constructors.
8. Destructors.

Prototypal inheritence only has two ways (it's simple!) to make 
inheritance work:

1. A way to create a new object (e.g. object literals).
2. A way to extend an existing object (e.g. `Object.create`).

Now that we can see we get a lot of benefits from Prototypal 
Inheritance, let's talk about JavaScript's brand of Prototypal 
Inheritance.

##  `.constructor`, `.__proto__` and `.prototype`

These three parts of JS are essential to having complete understanding 
of the language's inheritance system. Let's look at each:

#### Side Note: JavaScript Got It Wrong...

There are two breeds of Prototypal Inheritance - the prototypal pattern 
and JS' constructor pattern.

Unfortunately, JS was given the `new` keyword because:

> …we were pushing it as a little brother to Java, as a complementary 
language like Visual Basic was to C++ in Microsoft’s language families 
at the time. — Brendan Eich, Creator of JS

This is bad because when people look at JS, they think classical 
inheritance. Wrong. Wrong wrong wrong.

> This indirection was intended to make the language seem more familiar 
> to classically trained programmers, but failed to do that, as we can  
> see from the very low opinion Java programmers have of JavaScript. 
> JavaScript’s constructor pattern did not appeal to the classical  
> crowd. It also obscured JavaScript’s true prototypal nature. As a 
> result, there are very few programmers who know how to use the 
> language effectively.

##### In prototypal inheritance objects inherit from other objects.
__Constructors never come into the picture. This is what most confuses 
people.__

#### All about `.__proto__`, `.prototype` and `.constructor`

Now that we've gone through that necessary bit of explanation, let's 
look at this constructor pattern and see if we can't make sense of it.

###### Quick Definitions:

1. `Object.prototype.constructor` - Returns a reference (<u>**not**</u> 
   a string of the name) to the Object function that created the 
   instance's prototype.
2. `Object.prototype` - the prototype object on the constructor. It is 
   the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an 
   object with `new`.
3. [`__proto__`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto) - 
   the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve 
   methods. It's similar to an `attr_accessor` in Ruby. In general, 
   **you should never change or overwrite `.__proto__`** - it can lead 
   to a big break in your inheritance chain.

What does all this mean, though!?

Every object has a constructor, all the way up to the Function object 
constructor. Every constructor function has a prototype that is shared 
to each of the instances of the constructor. To access the prototype, JS 
uses `.__proto__` to reach to the constructor's prototype.

Therefore, `prototype` is not available on the instances themselves (or 
other objects), but only on the constructor functions.

Objects can take from multiple prototypes. This is what is known as the 
***Prototype Chain***.

##### Follow Up Questions:

- What is the purpose of a constructor?
- What does `.__proto__` do for us?
- Where are prototype objects found?

## Constructor Functions vs `Object.create()`

There are two ways to set a prototype (eventually three with ES2015 
classes - but for now, we'll focus on these two). A form of constructor 
function and `Object.create()`.

##### Constructor Functions

An object literal is a succinct way of creating a clone of 
`Object.prototype` and extending it with new properties.

Therefore:

``` javascript
var neo = new Object();

var mrAnderson = {};
```

Object literals are nothing but syntactic sugar. Both may now access the 
prototype of the Object object. Both are constructors as well.

##### `Object.create()`

This method comes to us from the great Douglas Crockford.

``` js
var trinity = {
  kickData: function () {
    console.log("Oh man, so much data is being kicked!");
  }
};

var morpheus = Object.create(trinity);
```

`Object.create()` creates a new object with the specified prototype 
object and properties. Many find this a much more beautiful way to 
access the prototype, because it does not obfuscate the power of 
prototypal inheritance with keywords from other inheritance models. It's
also a simple option to clone objects.

You've made it through the first jump into prototypal inheritance. Let 
me tell you, you still have a long way to go as there are endless 
opinions in how to properly use inheritance in JS - especially when you 
move into new paradigms of programming.

Make sure to read some of the references at the bottom if you're 
interested in learning more about JS's inheritance system and how it can 
be improved upon.

#### Final Questions:

1. What are the two (maybe three with ES2015) ways to set a prototype?
2. `objectName.constructor` will give a `_________` to/of an object's 
   `_________`.
3. Where can one find a `prototype` object?
4. What is the first parameter of `Object.create()`?
