## Office Life, Amyrite?

**Working with WDI students at GA can be a unique experience.**

There's no denying it: WDI students get crazy as the workload increases. Because of this, being a TA can sometimes be extremely stressful.

Luckily, there are a few tried and true methods that can both help the students, and the TA by giving structure to how you assist a student.

### Preparation

Like all things, preparation helps.

Of course, as a TA, you don't get too much time to prepare on any given day. That's why it helps to **stay in contact with the instructors.**

Some important things to keep in mind:

1. **Make sure you're on the repo!**
	- This is so important! Make sure you can pull from the class repo and see what's coming!
2. **Contact the Instructor**
	- Instructors are weird, busy creatures. Every night, they SHOULD send you the solution code, or give you some kind of hint as to what the students will be working on. In the case that it's 5:00pm and you still don't have the solution code, **please message one of the instructors on Slack to get the low-down**! I promise they won't be offended, but relieved they have such an awesome TA!!
3. **Make sure you're familiar with the topic.**
	- You're not an expert, and that's ok! They don't need an expert, they just need a point in the right direction. Use this time to practice skills that may have atrophied since graduation, so the students look forward to your shining face after class.

#### Holy Hell, I Don't Know the Answer

**It's ok!** Instructors don't always know the answer either!

This can be the most stressful time for a TA, but it doesn't have to be. The instructors often reiterate to students that TA's will not know the answer to every question.

But when you don't know a question, there's a great way to still assist the student!

**GTS** = **Google That Shit**

Show them your thought process; rather than searching for the answer on your own and giving them the answer at the end, walk them through your thought process.

### Psssh, Duh!

How to give help when the question seems so obvious can be tough.

When you do know the answer, try and follow these guidelines:

1. Your first action should never be to write it for them. **Keep your hands off the keyboard until you've really isolated the issue.** Also, make sure you **always ask before typing on their computer.** 
2. **25 minutes maximum for the neediest students** - We know there's always a couple. If there's a recurring issue, where you feel you're spending all your time with one student, just let them know you're only allowed to work with a student for 25 minutes. They should struggle on their own, and rarely will a problem take more time than 25 minutes.
3. **Your job is not to finish a feature** - isolate the problem, and help them along, but don't keep going through the feature. It can be really tough, and you'll see yourself doing it unintentionally - fight the urge!!!
4. Use **"stretching"** or **"breaking it down"** to find the core of their misunderstanding.

## Most Importantly, BE PRESENT!
Make sure you don't seem unapproachable - more than anything else, this is the key to being a great TA. 

Write a funny message on the wall above your head if you're wearing headphones, try and meet the students, relate your past experiences, etc. 

They're just like you! Make sure they feel comfortabel coming to you for help.
