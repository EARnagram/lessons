# Notes on June 13, 2016

Floater work weeks (not including morn ex):

- Reg instructor: 3 with 7-modules & 1 with 8-modules
- Floater: 7 - no after hours, no code reviews



Good Ideas - Wow:

- Projects - shorter?
- Tests are good, but we need to pull from the structure
  - Rails gone? React shorter? Shorter projects with multiple prompts.
- Build exact prompt, then give open ended template.
