            Roko's basilisk is a thought experiment about the potential risks
            involved in developing artificial intelligence. The experiment's
            premise is that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the
            future could retroactively punish those who did not help bring about
            its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible
            development of such a being.
