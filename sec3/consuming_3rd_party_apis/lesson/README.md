## Enter the Library of Babel

Borges wrote of a universe in the form of a
[library](https://libraryofbabel.info/). In this universal library is
a labriynth of hexaganol rooms, each containing 4 walls of books, each
410 pages in length. Supposedly infinite, it's said that all
iterations of books containing 410 pages were present in the library,
and if that were true, there could be one _messianiac deliverer_ that
has read _the one book_ that catalogs the entire libary.

By the end of this lesson, I hope that you are  *"el Hombre del
Libro"*, that can lead us to the "legible books" of the internet.

#### Using RESTful Web Services
Web APIs, or RESTful Web Services, can feel a lot like the Library of Babel, but
are significantly easier to navigate.

If only Borges' library had followed a REST architecture!

In our class, and in your life as Web Developers, you'll hear people
say APIs a lot, however, what they mean are [Web APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API),
specifically RESTful Web Services.

The best explanation I've heard of a Web API:

#### Computers use Web APIs, the way a human uses a website.

<img src="http://cdn2.business2community.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Robot-on-phone-with-caption-and-lipstick-iStock_000027629337Small.png" alt="sassy compy" height=300px>

In the same way we go to a site's contact page, and parse through the data to
find the phone number to tell that restaurant that they screwed up our ravioli
AGAIN, a computer uses a RESTful endpoint of an API to access data.

However, unlike humans, computers don't need (or want) any of the extra nonsense
we humans call styling. Only the raw data is necessary in these APIs.

Earlier today, we've seen how to produce an API. Let's revisit producing before
getting into consuming APIs.

## Producing the API

<img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZvSVnglHPEU/VLIlHh3k0dI/AAAAAAAAHmk/pK12MRmcc0Y/s1600/Eniac.jpg" alt="open server" height=400px>

You can access a RESTful web service (otherwise known as producing or exposing
the API) in a similar fashion to finding a book in a well-organized library.

__Imagine you're in middle school__:

- Your teacher gives you an assignment to write a paper about the Civil War.
- You go to your library called 'http://api.websterms.edu/lib'
- you then look in the '/history' section and...
- find the dewey decimal number for military history '/435'
- then extract only books on the civil war in '/civilwar'
- then find the exact book you needed by id '/45'

You've just hit an equivalent of an API endpoint:

`http://api.websterms.edu/lib/history/435/civilwar/45`

Now this is not a real website, but you'll see RESTful sites with a
similar structure. We access APIs using HTTP requests, much like the
one we used in our Rails projects.

#### Accessing APIs

We can access an API in many different ways:

1. From the terminal, we can use cURL (`curl`, originally named because of
   "see URL" - can be used asynchronously)
2. From the browser (a desktop GUI for HTTP requests)
3. Asynchronously from our node server using the `request` node package
4. Asynchronously from our client-side using AJAX requests

Today we're going to focus on `request`.  AJAX can become difficult to manage
due to its asynchronous nature and seemingly magical quality of overriding usual
__XDR__ / __CORS__ protection.

We'll deal with this a lot later, so I want to introduce the idea now. However,
we'll be communicating server to server today, so this won't be a problem in
this lesson.

#### XDR & CORS

Web browsers have a security policy called the same-site origin policy, which
blocks webpages from accessing data from a different domain.

Web sites often work around this policy by having their server request content
from another site's server in the backend, thus circumventing the check within
the browser, as shown in the following diagram.

![Non-XDR Diagram](https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC279943.gif)

__XDR__ - Cross-Domain Request

- Cross-Domain Requests are requests made to a server under a different domain.
  They break same-site origin policy, and therefore need a way to get around it.

![XDR](https://i-msdn.sec.s-msft.com/dynimg/IC283863.gif)

__CORS__ - Cross Origin Resource Sharing

- A resource makes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource from
  a different domain than the one which served itself. CORS gives web servers
  cross-domain access controls, which enable secure cross-domain data transfers.
  Modern browsers use CORS in an **API container** - such as AJAX - to mitigate
  risks of cross-origin HTTP requests.

Here's the kind of error you'll see:
![xml_http_req_err](http://www.codeguru.com/imagesvr_ce/2530/CORSFigure03.png)

It's important to understand **CORS is the protocol set on the `XMLHttpRequest`
object and in the response header. It allows an XDR to be made.**

> Questions:
> 1. What does XDR stand for?
> 2. What does CORS stand for?
> 3. When we're accessing another Restful Web Service from our server, do we 
>    need to set up CORS?

## Consume API - Find the Pokedex!

![pokedex](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/f7/f1/93/f7f1933d305c2e2d83bf67f570146b3e.jpg)

If all books exist in Borges' Library of Babel, then surely there's a pokedex in
there somewhere.

Let's use the starter code to learn how to use the `request` module.

When we manipulate and utilize data from outside sources, we are
_consuming_ the API. In this case, we're using the [PokéAPI](http://www.pokeapi.co/).

We'll also be using the module `locus` for line injections (like `binding.pry`).

This is what we're going to do:

1. Catch them all!
2. Start out with bulbasaur.
3. Access Jynx from our original pokedex.
4. Find a sprite of your favorite pokemon.

## Practice with the GitHub API

<img src="https://help.github.com/assets/images/site/be-social.gif" alt="github">

Everyone take 10 minutes to review the [GitHub documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
with your partner/s.

After you've reviewed the docs, complete the following:

1. Expose the class repo (as in ga-students, not your fork) using `curl`!
   - You may need to sign in to see this repo… remember, using cURL!

2. Now use the request package to access an instructor's account - then see if
   you can access the commits of one of their repos.
   - __Hint:__ Remember, the urls present in one response body may lead you to
     the one you're looking for.

3. Access your partner's project 2 commit log.

4. BONUS: See if you can produce the "bio" of username "EARnagram", using cURL
   - You'll need to `brew install jsawk`.
   - You'll also need to use the `--silent` flag instead of `-i`
   - Last, you'll need to use `jsawk` by piping in ( ` | ` ) the following:
     `jsawk 'return this.bio'`
5. DOUBLE BONUS: Change your own github bio using `PATCH`!

Congrats, you've officially become the Messianic Reading Guy!

You now contain the necessary know how to move through the labyrinth of RESTful
Web Services!

Let's review:

> - What is an API?
> - What is a Restful Web Service? Are they different from APIs?
> - What is an XDR, and how does CORS come into the picture?
> - Why is REST so important to navigating Web APIs?
