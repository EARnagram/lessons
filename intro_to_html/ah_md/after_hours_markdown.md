## Make a CSS Cheatsheet

Markdown is a simplified way of getting information onto a page without any design thrills.

It's clean. It's obvious. And it saves you OODLES of time in documenting your code.

### After Hours

**Tonight's after hours are to learn markdown syntax through creating a CSS cheatsheet.** 

This will test your ability to read documentation, while teaching you how to use MD. Remember, this is a *cheatsheet*, not an exhaustive reference. Include only the css properties you feel you'll use often.

If you want a markdown editor, I recommend [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).

Save your cheatsheet in your `WDI_DTLA_8/resources/cheatsheets` directory.
