## Make Cheatsheets for HTML, CSS, and Command Line

Markdown is a simplified way of getting information onto a page without any design thrills.

It's clean. It's obvious. And it saves you OODLES of time in documenting your code.

### After Hours

**Tonight's after hours are to learn markdown syntax through creating cheatsheets for HTML, CSS, and Bash (the Command Line).** 

This will test your ability to read documentation, while teaching you how to use markdown. 

Remember, this is a *cheatsheet*, not an exhaustive reference. Include only the tags, properties, and/or commands you feel you'll use often. [Here's an example.](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_DTLA_8/blob/master/resources/cheatsheets/mac_gui_cheatsheet.md)

If you want a markdown editor, I recommend [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/).

Save your cheatsheet in your `WDI_DTLA_8/resources/cheatsheets/` directory.
