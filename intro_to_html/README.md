## What is HTML?

![Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/fc/1a/e3/fc1ae3eb137cbe737f0e88a0788a6419.jpg)

In short: HyperText Markup Language.

HTML is the essential building blocks of website. It is the steel beams of your soon to be impressive, awe-inspiring, skyscraping website. Because it is so essential to every website, people often have a difficult time explaining what exactly the language does. In order to avoid any confusion, lets breakdown that garbled, unabbreviated title.

*Hypertext* - The method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called **hyperlinks** which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is *hyper* just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.

*Markup*  - This is what **HTML tags** do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (*italicised* text, for example).

*Language* - This one is pretty straightforward. It has its own syntax and structure like any other language, programmatic or human.

## The Doctype, <head> and <body>

Let's talk about the major pillars of every HTML Page:

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <title>Intro to HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
	<!-- Put all your site stuff in here!! -->
</body>
</html>
```
